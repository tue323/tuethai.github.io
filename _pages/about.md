Hi, I'm Tue (pronounced "Tway")! 

Growing up in the South Bay, surrounded by the sound of planes taking off, I developed a deep fascination with flight and performance. Today, I’m driven by the intersection of speed, precision, and smart design by the challenge of turning ambitious ideas into real, working solutions.

Through my experience in engineering teams, I’ve worked on aerodynamic optimization, mechanical design, electrical integration, and hands-on manufacturing. I enjoy bridging analysis with execution using simulation, testing, and iteration to deliver practical results.

I’m motivated by challenging problems that require both technical depth and teamwork, and I’m currently seeking opportunities in aerospace, advanced mobility, and high-performance engineering where I can continue learning and contributing to impactful systems.
