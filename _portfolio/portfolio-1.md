## TR-26 Rear Wing

Designed and optimized aerodynamic surfaces to maximize downforce efficiency and improve vehicle cornering stability.

---

### Engineering Highlights

- Evaluated multiple airfoil geometries in **ANSYS Fluent**
- Achieved **12% increase in lift-to-drag ratio**
- Conducted pressure and velocity contour analysis to validate downforce distribution
- Iterated parametric CAD models in **SolidWorks**
- Fabricated wing elements using carbon fiber wet layup and precision routing

---

### Results

The optimized rear wing increased rear downforce and aerodynamic efficiency, contributing to improved high-speed cornering stability and overall TR-26 vehicle performance.
